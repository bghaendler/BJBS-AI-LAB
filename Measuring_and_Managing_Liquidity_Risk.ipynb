        "    - Traditional FTP approaches indirectly addressed cash volatility through core and volatile splits and term liquidity premium assignments.\n",
        "    - The Basel III framework and internal stress testing allow for explicit linkage of product-level attributes to the sizing of the liquidity buffer.\n",

        "    - FTP frameworks should also account for individual clients as users or contributors of liquidity.\n",
        "    - Business units and corporate centers have conflicting interests that can hinder the development of finely tuned FTP frameworks.\n",
