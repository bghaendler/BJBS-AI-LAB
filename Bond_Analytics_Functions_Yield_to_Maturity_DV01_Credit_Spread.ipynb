        "\n",
        "This code provides three functions to calculate various analytics measures for a bond:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. `calculate_ytm(price, coupon, face_value, time_to_maturity, frequency)`: Calculates the Yield to Maturity (YTM) for a bond.\n",
        "2. `calculate_dv01(price, coupon, face_value, time_to_maturity, frequency)`: Calculates the DV01 (dollar value of a basis point) for a bond.\n",
        "3. `calculate_credit_spread(price, coupon, face_value, time_to_maturity, frequency, risk_free_rate)`: Calculates the Credit Spread for a bond.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Input Parameters:\n",
        "\n",
        "- `price`: The current price of the bond.\n",
        "- `coupon`: The coupon payment received per period.\n",
        "- `face_value`: The face value or par value of the bond.\n",
        "- `time_to_maturity`: The time to maturity of the bond in years.\n",
        "- `frequency`: The number of coupon payments per year.\n",
        "- `risk_free_rate`: The risk-free interest rate used to calculate the credit spread.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Calculating Yield to Maturity (YTM):\n",
        "\n",
        "The YTM represents the internal rate of return (IRR) of a bond, which equates the present value of all future cash flows (coupon payments and face value) to the current market price. The YTM is calculated iteratively using the Newton-Raphson method.\n",

        "\n",
        "### Calculating DV01:\n",
        "\n",
        "The DV01 (dollar value of a basis point) measures the change in the bond price for a 0.01% (1 basis point) change in yield to maturity. It is an important measure for bond risk management.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",

        "- $P$ is the current bond price.\n",
        "- $P'$ is the bond price for a slightly higher YTM (YTM + 0.0001).\n",

        "### Calculating Credit Spread:\n",
        "\n",
        "The Credit Spread represents the additional yield above the risk-free rate that investors demand for bearing the credit risk of the bond issuer. It measures the compensation for default risk.\n",
        "\n",
        "The Credit Spread is calculated as the difference between the bond's YTM and the risk-free interest rate.\n",
        "\n",
        "The formula to calculate the Credit Spread for a bond is:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$\n",

        "where:\n",
        "- `YTM` is the yield to maturity of the bond.\n",
        "- `Risk-Free Rate` is the risk-free interest rate used as a benchmark.\n",
