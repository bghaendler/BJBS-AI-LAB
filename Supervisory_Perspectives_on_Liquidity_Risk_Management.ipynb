        "# CHAPTER 10 Supervisory Perspectives on Liquidity Risk Management\n",
        "\n",
        "## INTRODUCTION\n",
        "\n",
        "- Financial institutions must understand their liquidity needs at an enterprise-wide level and be prepared for unexpected erosion of market liquidity.\n",
        "- The global liquidity crisis in 2007-08 highlighted challenges faced by banking organizations and renewed attention to liquidity risk management.\n",
        "- Banking supervisors have highlighted failures of firms to take basic principles of liquidity risk management into account when liquidity was plentiful.\n",
        "- Regulators have renewed emphasis on liquidity risk management in regulations such as the Enhanced Prudential Standards (EPS) and standards issued by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS).\n",
        "- Regulatory and supervisory requirements complement the quantitative measures implemented under the Basel III framework.\n",
        "- The chapter will review the evolution and range of regulatory and supervisory requirements relative to liquidity risk management, including firms' governance and internal controls frameworks.\n",
        "\n",
        "## RATING LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT WITH U.S. BANKING REGULATORS’ RATING SYSTEM\n",
        "\n",
        "- The CAMEL rating system was developed in 1979 to provide a uniform rating system for banks in the US.\n",
        "- The system covers financial, governance, and internal controls measures, with a focus on liquidity risk management practices.\n",
        "- Liquidity position, funding needs, and adequacy of funds management practices are important considerations in evaluating a financial institution's liquidity.\n",
        "- Banks should be able to manage unplanned changes in funding sources and react to market conditions affecting asset liquidation.\n",
        "- The board of directors of a bank should provide clear guidance on acceptable risk exposure levels and ensure the establishment of appropriate policies and procedures.\n",
        "- Regulatory requirements and supervisory expectations have evolved over time in response to financial market events, aiming to address certain practices in supervised banking organizations.\n",
        "- The assessment of management plays a crucial role in the CAMEL rating system, including the identification, measurement, monitoring, and control of liquidity position.\n",
        "- Regulatory releases from banking supervisors become increasingly prescriptive over time, shaping the framework of requirements and expectations.\n",
        "\n",
        "## FOUNDATIONS ESTABLISHED IN BCBS’ “SOUND PRACTICES FOR MANAGING LIQUIDITY IN BANKING ORGANIZATIONS”\n",
        "\n",

        "## CONCLUSION\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Supervised firms have questioned prescriptive measures by banking supervisors.\n",
        "2. Regulators have remained consistent with CAMEL ratings framework and BCBS 2000 for liquidity risk management practices and controls.\n",
        "3. Quantitative requirements (LCR, NSFR) and the U.S. implementation of G-SIB surcharge framework have become regulatory priorities.\n",
        "4. Emphasis on quantitative metrics has influenced regulatory reviews of supervised firms' information systems, data quality/capacity, and data management controls.\n",
        "5. Emerging qualitative requirements by global supervisors focus on intraday liquidity risk management practices.\n",
        "6. The emphasis of qualitative requirements has been on home country currency flows and stress testing of intraday flows.\n",
        "7. Regulators are likely to expand expectations to encompass global exposures and flows for larger systemically important firms in the near term."
